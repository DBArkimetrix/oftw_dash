3. **Launch the Beast**: You're almost there! Run the following command to start the Dash server:
    - `poetry run python app.py`
    - (Feel the power at your fingertips)

4. **Witness the Magic**: Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/) and behold the marvel you've just unleashed.
