    <h1>OFTW Dashboard – with compliments from the team at Arkimetrix Analytics</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard summarizes key metrics from the Metric Wishlist. The data pipeline is not currently connected to live source files, 
      but can be scheduled for automated updates as needed. <em>Refresh is not currently enabled.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Targets</h2>
    <p>
      A form is available to create or update targets by fiscal year to run different scenarios. Fiscal 2024–25 targets were updated using the provided spreadsheet.
      Monthly targets reflect prior-year seasonality where possible.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>KPI cards</b> on top gives the idea of how much achieved of Target for different metrics.</li>
      <li><b>Cumulative Money Moved </b>chart shows the journey of MM till FYTD with related labels, also providing view on target run rate based on PY pacing to reach current year's target.</li>
      <li><b>Active Pledge ARR (toggle to Current ARR + Remaining to Target)</b>chart shows the run of each chapter type category and its frequency to fulfill the gap to target.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently, target value update reflects per session per user only so when refreshed it will change to default. This can be enhanced in the future as needed. </p>

    <h2>Data Context</h2>
    <p>
      Visuals provide both numeric and comparative context to prior year and target values. Views include Monthly and Fiscal YTD perspectives.
      Future enhancements may support toggles between Monthly, Quarterly, and YTD views.
    </p>

    <h3>Date Table</h3>
    <p>
      A custom fiscal calendar is used, starting July 1. All aggregations (e.g., YTD) are based on this fiscal calendar.
    </p>

    <h3>Filters Applied</h3>
    <p>The following portfolios have been excluded:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One for the World Discretionary Fund</li>
      <li>One for the World Operating Costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Duplicate payment records (by ID) were also removed to ensure accuracy.</p>

    <h2>FX Rate Conversion to USD</h2>
    <p>
      Local currencies are converted to USD using monthly FX rates from the 
      <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/observations/group/FX_RATES_MONTHLY" target="_blank">Bank of Canada</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="code">XXX_to_USD = FXMXXXCAD / FXMUSDCAD</span></li>
      <li><span class="code">CAD_to_USD = 1 / FXMUSDCAD</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      FX rates are joined on a monthly lookup date, and all pledge and payment values are converted to USD using the corresponding rate. 
      Final values are saved in <span class="code">pledges.parquet</span> and <span class="code">payments.parquet</span>.
    </p>
